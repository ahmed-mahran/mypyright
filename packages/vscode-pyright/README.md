# Static Type Checker for Tensors

This is a fork of [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) with added features beyond accepted [typing PEPs](https://peps.python.org/topic/typing/) to support [typed tensors](https://github.com/ahmed-mahran/typedtensor).

## What is extra?

- Multiple Unpackings of Type Arguments
- Type Transformations of Variadic Type Variables
- Subscriptable Functions
- Static Type Programming (Type Macros)
  - Static Type Transformations (Type Maps)
  - Static Type Predicates (Refinement Types)

There is more to be added in future. Refer to [MyPyright](https://github.com/ahmed-mahran/mypyright) on GitHub for more details.
